Introduction To Machine Learning Project Work

Objective 
• To implement standard Machine Learning models and study theoretical concepts and their practical applications

Approach
• Developed a Polynomial regression model from scratch using only Numpy & Pandas libraries in python
• Implemented Logistic Regression and Decision Tree regressor using sklearn library, got an accuracy of 0.77
• Build a 3-layer Artificial Neural Network, utilising the Backpropagation algorithm and sigmoid function

Outcome 
• Executed the Artificial Neural Network on the data set and obtained an accuracy of 0.83 on test data
